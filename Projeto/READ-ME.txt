Here's the complete guide to construct the database from Xeno-Canto website:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:
    python downloadAudios.py BIRD_NAME NUM_OF_PAGES

    1.1. Arguments:
    1.1.1. 'BIRD_NAME' should be something like: vanellus+chilensis
    ** The '+' representing space
    1.1.2. 'NUM_OF_PAGES' is the number of pages you're downloading. Each page contains 30 (max) audio files.

2. Optionally you can convert all files into .wav. To do it, run the following:
    sudo python convert_into_wav.py BIRD_NAME
